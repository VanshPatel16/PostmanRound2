I have managed to create the backend for the social media app.
I have incorporated almost all the features,including bookmarking feature.
I could not manage to incorporate google oauth2 and frontend for this task.

I have used a jwt based authentication system,where i return a cookie containing the token and user details which are then further used when using the functionalities.

DB : MongoDB
Framework : Gin
